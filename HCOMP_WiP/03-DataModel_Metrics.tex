\subsection{Goal}
% \agp{Aren't bounding boxes inherently rectangular? I am not clear about the usage.}
For any specified object in an image, 
there exists a {\em tight}\dor{why is specifying "tight" segmentation? Not sure purpose of this paragraph} segmentation 
which exactly outlines the object; we call this
the {\em ground-truth} segmentation for this object. 
Workers are asked to provide segmentations for objects;
they often do not provide the ground-truth segmentation,
and their segmentation is often noisy.
Thus our goal is the following:
given a raw image and multiple noisy worker segmentations 
for a specific object, estimate the 
ground truth segmentation for that object. \todo[inline]{Show one image + ground truth here}
