\section{Error Analysis\label{sec:error}}
\par On collecting and analyzing a number of crowdsourced segmentations (described in Section~\ref{dataset}), we found that common worker segmentation errors can be classified into three types: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Semantic Ambiguity:} workers have differing opinions on whether particular regions belong to an object (Figure~\ref{error_examples} left: annotations around `flower and vase' when `vase' is requested); \item \textbf{Semantic Mistake:} workers annotate the wrong object entirely (Figure~\ref{error_examples} right: annotations around `turtle' and `monitor' when `computer' is requested.)
	\item \textbf{Boundary Imperfection:} workers make unintentional mistakes while drawing the boundaries, either due to low image resolution, small area of the object, or lack of drawing skills (Figure~\ref{tile_demo} left: imprecision around the `dog' object).
\end{itemize}
\par Semantic ambiguity and mistakes have also been observed in prior work~\cite{Sorokin2008,Lin2014,Gurari2018}, which noted that disagreement in worker responses can come from questions that are ambiguous or difficult to answer, such as segmenting a individual person from a crowd. Since there are multiple workers annotating each object, each object can suffer from multiple types of error: we found that out of the 46 objects in our dataset, 9 objects suffered from type one error and 18 objects from type two error. Almost all objects suffer from some form of type three error of varying degrees of imprecision around the object boundary. The main evaluation methods highlighted in Section~\ref{precision} focuses on resolving the imprecise, ``sloppy'' bounding box errors. In Section~\ref{perspective}, we discuss a preprocessing method eliminates semantic ambiguities and errors. %We present our experimental evaluation in Section~\ref{sec:experiment}.
%\par Quality evaluation methods in prior work have largely focused on minimizing boundary imperfection issues. So, we first describe our novel aggregation-based algorithms designed to reduce boundary imperfections in Section~\ref{precision}. Next, in Section~\ref{perspective}, we discuss a preprocessing method eliminates semantic ambiguities and errors, also observed in prior work~\cite{Sorokin2008,Lin2014,Gurari2018}. We present our experimental evaluation in Section~\ref{sec:experiment}.% and compare them with existing retrieval-based methods in
