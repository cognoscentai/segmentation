%The crowdsourced approach can be largely classified as retrieval or aggregation-based methods. We further explore hybrid algorithms that makes use of signals that span over multiple categories, described in our technical report.

%Many large-scale efforts in crowdsourced image segmentation contain little to no information on the quality characterization and evaluation of the collected dataset~\cite{Torralba2010,MartinFTM01,Li2009,Gurari2015}, which indicate the lack of standardized approaches for quality evaluation. 
As shown in Figure \ref{flowchart}, quality evaluation methods for crowdsourced segmentation can be largely classified into two categories:

\stitle{Retrieval-based methods} seek to pick the ``best'' worker segmentation based on some scoring criteria that evaluates the quality of each segmentation, including the use of vision information~\cite{Vittayakorn2011,Russakovsky2015}, expectation-maximization (EM) approaches for bounding box quality estimation~\cite{MDWWelinder2010}, and click-stream behavior \cite{Cabezas2015,Sameki2015,Sorokin2008}.

\stitle{Aggregation-based methods} use multiple worker segmentations to produce a single combined segmentation. %Our paper formulate a novel ``tiles'' approach for aggregation methods that operates on discrete non-overlapping units composed of all worker segmentations overlaid on top of each other. 
Aggregation-based majority vote have been introduced in Sameki et al. (\citeyear{Sameki2015}) as a way for aggregating expert segmentations to obtain a ground truth segmentation for evaluation purposes. 

%specialized segmentation interfaces or workflows that ensures that the annotations collected are of high quality, including 
Orthogonal methods to improve segmentation quality include periodic verification workflows~\cite{Lin2014,Everingham15}, specialized segmentation interfaces~\cite{Song2018}, and vision-based supervision of crowdsourced segmentation\cite{Russakovsky2015,Gurari2016}. Our paper do not compare against these methods since they are not easily reproducible and could be used for quality improvement on top of any of the algorithms described in this paper.  %Since these policy-based methods are interface-dependent, require expensive expert-drawn ground-truth annotations or vision information, the results are not easily reproducible. In addition, the segmentations collected by the simple click-and-draw interface in many of the large scale segmentation efforts can not be improved with this technique as a post-processing method. Due to the lack of reproducibility, our paper do not compare against these policy-based methods in extensive details.
