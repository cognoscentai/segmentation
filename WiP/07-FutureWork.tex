\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we perform an extensive study of several image segmentation algorithms spanning semi-supervised vision approaches, crowdsourced retrieval approaches, and novel crowdsourced aggregation approaches. We identified three different types of errors that workers typically make on segmentation tasks, some caused by differing perspectives, and developed a clustering-based method to filter out workers that are making semantic errors. We demonstrate the strength of our worker clustering algorithm as well as the aggregation-based segmentation algorithms through extensive experiments in 1) its ability to improve as more worker segmentations are collected and 2) yield better performance than retrieval-based methods. We also found that while majority vote is a fairly simple algorithm, it performs nearly as well as the advanced EM and greedy inference approaches. Our code is open source and available for researchers to benchmark and compare techniques. Our work represents a first step in understanding and comparing the different types of algorithms available for image segmentation tasks. It opens a number of exciting directions for exploration, for instance: (a) Studying the effect of task difficulty, or worker qualities across different, objects, and (b) Designing better hybrid algorithms that combine the different types of algorithms described in this paper.
