\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We identified three different types of errors for crowdsourced image segmentation, developed a clustering-based method to capture the semantic diversity caused by differing worker perspectives, and introduced novel aggregation-based methods that produce segmentations that are more accurate than existing retrieval-based methods.
\par Our preliminary studies show that our worker quality models are good indicators of the actual accuracy of worker segmentations. We also observe that the greedy algorithm is capable of achieving close-to-perfect segmentation accuracy with ground truth information. 
Given the success of aggregation-based methods, including the simple majority vote algorithm, we plan to use our worker quality insights to improve our EM and greedy algorithms. 
We are also working on using computer vision signals to further improve our algorithms.
% Bridging the gap between our current approach to the maximum potential of aggregation-based methods can result in more accurate and perspective-aware crowdsourced segmentation outputs in the future.
