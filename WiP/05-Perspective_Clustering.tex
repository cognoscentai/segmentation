\section{Perspective Resolution\label{sec:perspective}}
% \subsection{Worker Clustering}
To resolve differing worker perspectives, we develop a clustering-based approach.
% is based on the intuition that workers with similar perspectives  will have segmentations that are closer to each other. 
We capture the similarity between a pair of workers by computing the Jaccard score between their segmentations and perform spectral clustering to separate workers into clusters. Figure \ref{error_examples} bottom illustrates how spectral clustering is capable of dividing the worker responses into clusters with meaningful semantic associations, reflecting the crowd's diversity of perspectives in completing same task. Clustering results can be used as a preprocessing step to any of the quality evaluation algorithms by keeping only the segmentations that belong to the largest cluster, which is typically free of any semantic errors.

\par In addition, clustering offers an additional benefit of preserving worker's semantic intentions in the case where there are multiple instances of different errors. For example, the mistakened clusters in Figure~\ref{error_examples} bottom right contained semantic concepts ``monitor'' and ``turtle''. While these are considered \textit{bad} annotations for this particular task, this cluster of annotation can provide more data for another semantic segmentation task ``monitor''. A potential future work includes adding additional crowdsourcing tasks for semantic labeling of clusters (which is cheaper and more accurate than segmentation) to enable reuse of annotations across multiple objects and lower the cost of data collection.
