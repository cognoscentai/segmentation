\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
In this paper, we identified three different types of errors for crowdsourced image segmentation, and developed a clustering-based method capture the semantic diversity caused by differing worker perspectives. Moreover, we introduced novel aggregation-based methods that performed better when compared to existing retrieval-based methods.
\par Given the success of aggregation-based methods, our future work investigates why and how our EM and greedy approaches differ from majority vote. Our preliminary studies show that worker qualities are good indicators of actual Jaccard of worker segmentations with ground truth and that the greedy algorithm is capable of achieving close-to-perfect segmentation accuracy with ground truth information. We have also explored using vision information to improve these algorithms. Bridging the gap between our current approach to the maximum potential of aggregation-based methods can result in more accurate and perspective-aware crowdsourced segmentation outputs in the future.
