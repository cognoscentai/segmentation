\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
In this paper, we introduce novel aggregation-based methods for crowdsourced image segmentation and compare them with existing retrieval-based methods. Moreover, we identified three different types of errors that workers typically make on segmentation tasks, and developed a clustering-based method capture the semantic diversity caused by differing worker perspectives.
\par Given the success of aggregation-based models, our future work investigates why and how our EM and greedy approaches differs from majority vote. We have preliminary studies that shows that worker qualities are good indicators of actual Jaccard of worker segmentations with ground truth and we have also shown that the greedy algorithm is capable of achieving close-to-perfect segmentation accuracy with ground truth information. Bridging the gap between our current approach with the full potential of aggregation-based methods can result in more accurate and perspective-aware crowdsourced segmentation outputs.
