\section{Introduction\label{sec:intro}}
Precise, instance-level object segmentation is crucial for identifying and tracking objects in a variety of real-world emergent applications of autonomy, including robotics\cite{Natonek1998}, image organization and retrieval\cite{Yamaguchi2012}, and medicine~\cite{Irshad2014}. To this end, there has been a lot of work on employing crowdsourcing to generate training data for computer vision, including Pascal-VOC~\cite{Everingham15}, LabelMe~\cite{Torralba2010}, OpenSurfaces~\cite{bell15minc}, and MS-COCO~\cite{Lin2012}. Unfortunately, raw data collected from crowdsourced image processing tasks are known to be noisy due to varying degrees of worker skills, attention, and motivation~\cite{bell14intrinsic,MDWWelinder2010}. 
\par In order to deal with these challenges, many have employed heuristics indicative of crowdsourced segmentation quality~\cite{Cabezas2015,Sameki2015,Sorokin2008}. While this approach identifies the segmentation drawn by more diligent workers, since it simply picks one \textit{best} worker-produced segmentation as the solution, it ends up discarding the majority of the worker responses and is limited by what the best worker can do. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of aggregation-based methods, capable of incorporating portions of responses from multiple workers into a combined segmentation. To our surprise, despite its intuitive simplicity, we have not seen this class of algorithms described or evaluated in prior work. We evaluate its performance against existing retrieval-based methods. To enhance the performance of these algorithms, we propose a preprocessing technique that resolves different worker perspectives in multiple segmentations.

% Perhaps add sentence to say that finding the best worker is also often not easy? (to set up defenses for the fact that best worker algo performs pretty well on our dataset)
